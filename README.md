# Assignment 5 â€“ LVM Striping, Docker Bind Mounts, SSH, and Ansible

This assignment combined storage, containerization, and automation practices in a Linux-based virtual environment.

## Topics Covered

- **LVM Striping (RAID-0):** Created striped logical volumes across multiple disks to improve performance.
- **Docker Bind Mounts:** Mounted host LVM volumes inside Docker containers to persist and share data.
- **Password-less SSH:** Configured bridged LXD containers for remote access using key-based authentication.
- **Ansible Automation:** Wrote and ran a minimal Ansible playbook to automate file deployment across containers.

## Environment

Completed on a Debian 12 virtual machine. Containers were created and managed using LXD. Docker was used for containerization, and Ansible for configuration management and deployment.
